### TRACE
***
<code><b>TRACE</b> {<b>ON</b>|<b>OFF</b>}</code>

Turns line number tracing on or off. If line number tracing is on, BASIC prints a tag <samp>[100]</samp> to the console when program line <code>100</code> is executed, and so forth.

#### Notes
Tracing is turned off by the [`NEW`](#NEW) and [`LOAD`](#LOAD) statements.
