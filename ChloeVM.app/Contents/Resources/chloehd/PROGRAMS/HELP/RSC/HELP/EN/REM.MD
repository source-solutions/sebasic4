### REM
***
<code>{<b>REM</b>|<b>'</b>} [<var>anything</var>]</code>

Ignores everything until the end of the line. The `REM` statement is intended for comments. Everything after `REM` will be stored in the program unaltered and uninterpreted. Apostrophe (`'`) is an alias for `REM`.

Note that a colon `:` does not terminate the `REM` statement; the colon and everything after it will be treated as part of the comment.
